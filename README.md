# Earthly-Crate
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Small businesses are booming these days, and they require a lot of packaging and shipping material to ensure that their product reaches the customer safely. 
A significant amount of plastic and carbon-filled packaging results in a growing carbon footprint, and the brand suffers as a result.
We intend to create a platform that will offer small businesses eco-friendly alternatives for packaging and shipping their products while maintaining the same level of safety and significantly reducing carbon footprints.
These shipping products will be reasonably priced.

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
Build a platform that helps small businesses transition to sustainable production methods and provides resources for eco-friendly packaging and shipping. The application must allow organizations to track their carbon footprint and offer personalized suggestions for reducing their environmental impact.
